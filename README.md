Welcome to Voltage!

Voltage a _powerful_ python optimizer/compiler that does: 

* Comment removal

By testing if comments can affect compile time, it was found that they _can_ slow down compile time if there are more than 5 in a program. So we remove single line comments. We do _not_ string multiline comments as they can contain copyright, and important notes

So much more to come! 

Voltage is very beta (and JANK), so please don't judge Voltage to harshly and leave issues in discussions or issues for us to fix or change!

## Installation

Download the latest version of the releases tab. We recommend _not_ installing pre-releases because they may be pretty JANK, and some actions may not work.

After you download the zip file, unzip it and open it in your terminal. Then run `install` file by running `./install`, and it should install it to your path, and then you can run `voltage` ***whenever***, ***wherever***.

You can also run the `remove` file to delete voltage.

## Usage 

Run `voltage -h` to see a list of commands!
